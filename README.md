EE551 Project Proposal

Introduction
I like playing rhythm game like Hatsune Miku, Beat-MP3 and Taiko Master. Thus, I hope to design my own rhythm game to let other players challenge their sense of rhythm while the music is on.
Here is the introduction and summary of the project.

Architecture
Game include 4 difficulties
* Easy mode
* Normal mode
* Hard mode
* Master mode
In the easy mode, the pace of icons on the screen is the slowest, letting the game 'rookies' to enhance their playing skill while enjoying the music.
In the normal mode, the icons increase and the pace is a little bit faster. It is the most common mode among the players, not too slow but not too fast.
In the hard mode, the rhythm is much quicken and requires a player's very good sense to react to the icon timely. Never easy to finish the entire music play for normal players, but very suitable for pro players to update their high-score.
In the master mode, the pace has reached the 'ghost' level. Excellent sense of rhythm and reaction speed is crucial. Only top players can accomplish this level.

ToDo
The rhythm game focus on the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press keys on the keyboard correctly in a sequence dictated on the screen, which helps to increase the score. When the music is finished, the score appears and if a new score is higher, current highest score will be covered. 
However, if the player fails to press the key as the icon tells, a miss will be counted. Up to 3 misses before the music ends leads to the 'game over'.
